`
patterns are proven solutions
patterns can be easily reused
patterns can be expressive

reusing patterns assists 
in preventing minor issues 
that can cause major problems 
in the applicattion development process.

patterns can provide generalized solutions 
which are documented in a fashion 
that doesn't require them to be tied 
to a specific problem.

certain patterns can actually decrease
the overall file-size footprint of our code
by avoiding repetition.

patterns add to a developer's vocabulary,
which makes communication faster.

patterns that are frequently used
can be improved over time by harnessing
the collective experiences other developers
using those patterns contribute back to the
design pattern community.

solves a particular problem
the solution to this problem cannot be obvious
the concept described must have been proven
it must describe a relationship

fitness of purpose
usefulness
applicability

a context
a system of forces that a arises in that context
a configuration that allows these forces to resolve themselves in context
